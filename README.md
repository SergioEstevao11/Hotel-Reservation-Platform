# Hotel-Reservation-Platform

This project provisions a cloud environment using **Terraform** on AWS for Hotel Reservations. It includes a Python web service hosted in ECS Fargate and a message broker powered by SNS + SQS.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Python web service deployed with ECS Fargate
- ✅ SNS Topic + SQS Queues (as Message Broker)
- ✅ DynamoDB (for data persistence)
- ✅ Secure networking (VPC, private subnets, endpoints, IAM, KMS)
- ✅ Logs via CloudWatch
- ✅ Encrypted at rest (DynamoDB)

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed and configured:

- ✅ AWS account with admin permissions
- ✅ AWS CLI (`aws configure`)
- ✅ [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- ✅ [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone
cd ./infrastructure
```

2. Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
3. Preview Plan
```bash
terraform plan
```
4.  *🔐 Task Image ECR Setup (First-Time Users)*
- **Create an ECR Repository** (or use Terraform for this)
    ```bash
    terraform apply -target=module.ecr
    ```
- Execute the deploy_ecr.sh script to publish the image
    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy_ecr.sh
    ```
- Generate the lambda zip files
    ```bash
  cd lambdas
  for f in *_handler.py; do zip "${f%.py}.zip" "$f"; done
    ```
5. Initiate the project
```bash
terraform apply
```

## ⚙️ Variables

You can configure all main inputs. Example:

- region           = "eu-west-1"
- cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"
- availability_zones = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b"]

## 🎯 Main Purpose

The idea of this project was to create a solid, scalable foundation for a reservation backend system for hotels.

---
## 🧠 Design Decisions

Fargate for lower overhead, and its serverless container nature, serving as the API host.

Application Load Balancer (ALB) to serve as the system’s web-facing entry point and balance traffic between tasks across multiple Availability Zones.

SNS + SQS (Fan-out architecture) for asynchronous processing and decoupled task execution per endpoint, promoting parallelism, task and error isolation, and better observability

DynamoDB for fast, out-of-the-box scalable NoSQL backend.

VPC Endpoints to enable secure service access (e.g., ECR, DynamoDB) without public internet exposure.


## ⚡️ Features - Endpoints

### /reservation 

Creates a reservation for a specific user
Command to test:
```bash
curl -X POST http://<alb-arn>.<region>.elb.amazonaws.com/reserve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "Lucio",
    "hotel": "Falkensteiner",
    "check_in": "2025-07-01",
    "check_out": "2025-07-05"
  }'
  ```
- Returns reservation_id
- The **Fargate** task will create the entry in the **DynamoDB**
- After that, the **email**, **updater**, **payment** & **analytics** tasks will take place
- The **payment** lambda will put the attribute "paid" to true, symbolizing a payed reservation

## 🧑‍💻 Future Improvements

- Enable encryption for all services (SNS, SQS, etc.) & better isolation of permission in resources
- Utilize **ACM** to change the HTTP communication to HTTPS
- Place a **WAF** in front of the **ALB** for input sanitation and general web security
- Use email **Lambda** + **SES/SMS** for customer-facing notifications (emails and texts)
- Migrate **DynamoDB** to **RDS/Aurora** for more relational consistency and complex querying
- Replace payment **Lambda** with a **Step Function** to support longer-lived workflows
- **S3** + **Athena** for data analytics
